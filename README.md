# 116117bot

## What is this?
The [116117 Impfterminservice](https://www.impfterminservice.de) provides COVID-19 vaccination appointments for a wide range of German states. Unfortunately, it does not alert registered users when appointments become available, so users are required to manually monitor it. This is a proof of concept for a simple [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)-powered bot that monitors the site and alerts via STDOUT and optionally push notification once appointments are available.

ðŸ¦  Please use this responsibly to keep it available and functional. 

## Requirements
* Node.js (>v14)
* If you want to receive push notifications for available appointments, a [Pushover](https://pushover.net) account.
* One or multiple registration code URLs for impfterminservice.de (freely available if conditions for vaccination are met).
